# sf-aura-component-countdownTimer
An Aura Component that counts down time from user input. As a lifelong learner for an enterprise, time management is key. I can now schedule "power hours" dedicated to a single task. Time can be elusive, but with this quick and easy to use component, I can hold myself accountable and more importantly increase my productivity. Another use case for the countdown timer, is for a case agent working on a case.
